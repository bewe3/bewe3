                    <h2>History</h2>
                <p>As a composer, he composes music that portrays strong emotions and feelings, drawing heavy inspiration from cinema scores. He has been composing for most of his life and has been studying composition in his free time under many great teachers. His goal with each composition is to leave both listeners and players feeling like they've been on an emotional journey or have learned something deeper about life. His motto with composition is “I'll never write a piece that doesn't have a point”</p>
<p>As a percussionist, he has played with high school groups, community theaters, and has toured nationally with his university's Symphony Band and Symphony Orchestra.
He has written many compositions for various ensemble types, including solo piano, string quintet, marching drum corps, indoor percussion, wind ensemble, concert band, choir, and more.</p>
